# What's new in FactorIA

The editor shows these notes when it offers an update, and each release on GitHub uses its section. Newest first.

## Unreleased

Upload your phone builds

- Upload your iOS build to TestFlight and App Store Connect from your AI or the command line (`publish.appstore`,
  on a Mac): you archive the game in Xcode as before, FactorIA sends the `.ipa` with an App Store Connect API key. Run it
  with `dryRun` first to see the exact command.
- Upload your Android release bundle to Google Play (`publish.googleplay`, needs fastlane): pick the track (internal
  testing by default), leave the release as a draft or roll it out, and send the "What's new" text per language from
  files of your project. A bundle signed with the debug key is refused before anything is sent. Google Play still wants the
  first bundle of a new app uploaded by hand.
- Your keys stay in files outside the project and are never shown or logged.

## 0.1.6

Menus and on-screen interface

- New interface pieces for your game: buttons, toggles, sliders, text fields, scrolling lists and panels with
  stretchable backgrounds, laid out in rows, columns or grids. Players use them with the mouse, the keyboard or a
  gamepad.
- Scripts can switch to full screen, change the window size, vsync and frame-rate cap, let players remap the controls,
  show the right button names for their gamepad, take typed text, and show or hide the cursor.
- A menus guide your AI follows to build a main menu, options, a pause menu, credits and a loading screen when your game
  needs them. New projects still start empty.
- Pausing really pauses now: physics, particles and animations stop too, while a pause menu keeps working.

Art, sound and music made by AI

- Your AI can generate images, sprite sheets, sound effects, music, voices and 3D models with the providers you set up
  (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Meshy), keeping one style and colour palette across a game.
- Every generated or imported file remembers where it came from, and exports include `AI_CONTENT_DISCLOSURE.md` with
  the answers Steam asks about AI-generated content.
- Import Aseprite, Photoshop (PSD), OBJ and FBX files (FBX needs Blender or FBX2glTF installed), and cut sprite sheets
  into frames automatically.
- Lighter games: textures are compressed for each platform and packed into atlases, long music streams instead of
  loading whole into memory, and sounds can be evened out to the same loudness.
- `factoria validate` warns about images that are too big, sounds that clip or are too quiet, and games over a store's
  size limit.

Native plugins

- A game can bring its own native code as a plugin (C or C++ on desktop, Java or Kotlin on Android, libraries on iOS)
  without changing the engine. Plugins can live outside the game's folder, for SDKs you are not allowed to share.

## 0.1.5

- Exported Windows games open without a black console window, and the `.exe` carries your game's name and version
  (Properties in File Explorer shows them).
- Every run of a game writes a `log.txt` in the game's save folder, so a player can send it to you when something goes
  wrong.
- Exporting no longer fails on Windows when the output folder is deep enough to make paths longer than 260 characters.
- When a text uses characters its font does not have (Chinese, Japanese or Korean with the default font, for example),
  the log says which characters are missing and which font has them, instead of leaving the text blank without a word.
- When a command fails, your AI assistant always gets an error it can read and act on.

## 0.1.4

- Android: export your game as an APK to test or an AAB for Google Play, signed with your own key, with its icon.
- New Export window in the editor, with a button per platform and the settings each one needs (name, version, icons).
  What an export still lacks (Android SDK, players for another system) is installed in one click, or with
  `factoria setup` from a terminal.
- macOS: FactorIA is signed and notarized by Apple, so it opens without a security warning.
- iPhone, iPad and Apple Silicon Macs: touches and clicks land where they should, and games run on real devices.
- Android: a game you leave and open again starts correctly.
- The editor's title shows the FactorIA version and the open project.
- Exporting again only replaces a folder an earlier export made, never a folder of yours.
- Scripts: a warning when a method looks like a misspelled event name (for example `onUpdat`), which would otherwise
  never be called.
- License: FactorIA is MIT and the templates are MIT-0, so your game's code is yours to license as you like. Exported
  games include the license notices they need (`FACTORIA_NOTICES.txt`).

## 0.1.3

- Windows installer: installs for your user without an administrator prompt, adds FactorIA to the Start menu and
  makes `factoria` work in any terminal.
- Linux: a single-file AppImage, besides the `.tar.gz`. macOS: one download for Apple Silicon and Intel.
- Android and iOS export work straight from the download: you no longer need the engine's source code.
- Gamepads: hundreds more models are recognised on Linux, and on Android an unplugged pad frees its slot.
- 3D physics: balls roll and spin naturally when hit off-centre, resting bodies sleep and wake like in 2D, and fast
  objects no longer pass through walls.

## 0.1.2

- Editor: fixes in the AI chat, and projects can be deleted from the project list.
- Destroying an object also removes its physics body.
- Your AI assistant can export the game by itself.
- Screenshots taken by tests always show a complete, up-to-date frame.

## 0.1.1

- Editor: Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V work.

## 0.1.0

The first release of FactorIA, a 2D and 3D game engine made for an AI to build your game.

- Games are plain text (scenes in JSON, logic in JavaScript), so an AI can read and change every part of them, check
  its work and run tests.
- The editor is built around an AI chat: send pictures as references, keep several chats with their history, see how
  much of your plan you have used, and choose the model for each AI role.
- Templates to start from: a 2D platformer, an empty 2D game and an empty 3D game.
- 2D and 3D physics, gamepads, and play sessions that can be replayed exactly, with a report your AI can read.
- Downloads for Windows, macOS and Linux. The editor offers each new version and updates itself when you say so.
