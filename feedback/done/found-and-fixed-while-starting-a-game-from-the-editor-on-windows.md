# Found and fixed while starting a game from the editor on Windows

The editor's AI Assistant had never run with a real CLI agent on Windows (the process runner had no Windows test), so
the first try failed three ways, each fixed and covered by a test:

- `claude` and `codex` are npm `.cmd` shims, and `cmd.exe` cut the prompt at its first line break (it would also expand
  `%VAR%` and run text after `&`). The built-in templates now send the prompt on standard input (a template without
  `{prompt}` does this); arguments a `.cmd` cannot take safely are refused; a `.cmd` path with spaces works (`/s`).
- The MCP server `factoria` was not found when `factoria` was started by path: it now puts its own directory first on
  PATH for the agents it starts.
- In `-p` mode Claude Code asked before every MCP tool, so the agent could not use the engine: the template now passes
  `--allowedTools mcp__factoria`.
- Ctrl+V and Ctrl+C did nothing in any text box of the editor (the AI Assistant's input included): sokol_app's clipboard
  was never enabled, and sokol_imgui swallows the Ctrl+V key to paste on the clipboard event instead. Pasting a picture
  into the AI Assistant never worked either. The clipboard is now on (1 MB of text), and on Windows a clipboard with a
  picture and no text no longer pastes the previous text again, so Ctrl+V attaches the picture. The editor autotest
  pastes into the AI Assistant input.
