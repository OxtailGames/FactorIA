# Engine feedback report

Status: 55 entries reported by the four example games; all 55 verified fixed-in-engine, 0 open.
Regenerate the ranked list with `factoria feedback collect examples/sky-hopper examples/neon-swarm examples/gem-roller examples/block-push --out feedback/ROADMAP.md` (then re-add the milestones section).


0 entries from 4 project(s), 0 distinct gap(s). Ranked by total occurrences x severity weight (blocker 8, major 4, minor 2, nice-to-have 1).

_No open feedback entries._

# Next engine milestones

Hand-written triage section (the ranked list above is generated; regenerate it with the command in
`feedback/README.md` and keep this section). Triage date 2026-10-13, against commit `e2b0090`: of the 55
entries from the four example games, the engine already fixed most; the work packages below cover what is left,
plus two packages for gaps seen while verifying that no game has hit yet (marked *proactive*).

Re-triage 2026-10-13, after `40b049c`: the last three open entries are fixed (SH/FB-0015 in `ebb054d`,
SH/FB-0014 in `ae8bb15`, NS/FB-0008 in `40b049c`). M1-M4 are done; M5 is the only package left and no game has
reported its gaps yet.

Sizes: S = under a day for an AI agent, M = 1-3 days, L = a week or more. Ids are `<game>/FB-n`
(sky-hopper = SH, neon-swarm = NS, gem-roller = GR, block-push = BP).

## M1. Docs and templates match the engine (S, highest value per effort) — DONE in this release

Closes: NS/FB-0002, GR/FB-0002, BP/FB-0001 (AI_GUIDE "planned" markers), BP/FB-0017 (EXTENDING "planned"),
BP/FB-0002 (GETTING_STARTED in Spanish, stale status table), BP/FB-0013 (TouchInfo fields), BP/FB-0015
(Shape2D pivot/anchor in COMPONENTS.md), NS/FB-0004 (2d-empty template and AI_GUIDE 9.4 use a clipped
`pivot [0,0]` HUD text), SH/FB-0016 (tilemap collision rules), GR/FB-0010 (3D recipes), NS/FB-0010 (replay
format). Only the entries whose text is still missing from `docs/*.md` stay open; see each entry's notes.

Acceptance criteria:
- `grep -n "(planned)" docs/*.md` lists only commands that really do not exist (check each with
  `factoria commands` / `--help`); a docs test fails when a command documented as planned runs.
- `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` (or an English twin) is English and its status table matches the shipped CLI.
- Templates `2d-empty` and AI_GUIDE 9.4 use a HUD that is not clipped (test: screenshot of the template at
  frame 3 has text pixels in rows 0..60 and none missing at the top; use `anchor [0,0]` + `pivot [0,1]`).
- AI_GUIDE has a "3D recipes" section with: chase camera, camera-relative movement, ground check, trigger
  pickup (state which components a 3D trigger needs), moving platform; every code block runs in a test.
- `docs/COMPONENTS.md` is regenerated from `factoria api --md` and shows `pivot`, `anchor`, `blend`,
  `autoDestroy`, `oneWay`, `rollWithMotion`; TouchInfo fields are commented in the typings.

## M2. CLI and test-harness diagnostics (S) — DONE in this release

Closes: BP/FB-0018, NS/FB-0010 (code part), SH/FB-0015.

Acceptance criteria:
- `factoria call project.<tool>` for a tool that throws `ToolError(msg, hint, data)` exits 1 and prints
  `data` (JSON) on stderr or stdout, same content as `call --batch` (test in `tools/cli/tests/integration.py`).
  The docs say clearly that only `ToolError` fails a call (a returned `{ok:false}` exits 0), or `{ok:false}`
  is made to exit 1 as well.
- `--input replay.json` and `game.input` warn (and `factoria run` exits non-zero with `--strict`) on unknown keys
  such as `"bogus"` or a misspelt `"press"`; the warning names the frame and key.
- `factoria test` prints `console.log` from tests under the failing/passing test without `--log-level info`.
- Test harness exposes `game.audioLog()` (list of `{frame, path, volume, bus}`) and
  `expect(game.audioLog()).toContainPlayed(path)`; a test plays a sound from a behaviour and asserts it.
  Done in `ebb054d` (plus the `audio.log` command for MCP/CLI agents; Sky Hopper's tests assert its sounds).

## M3. 2D level authoring and cameras (M) — DONE (`ae8bb15`)

Closes: SH/FB-0004, SH/FB-0014 (and removes the hand-made Python/JS level builders in sky-hopper).

Acceptance criteria:
- New `CameraFollow2D` behaviour/component (target id, offset, damping, `bounds` rect, clamps against the
  real view size, correct after a window resize); test: camera never shows outside `bounds` for 600 frames of
  a target running past the edge, in 1280x720 and 800x600.
- Tilemap object layer: `Tilemap.objects` (or `tilemap.paint` / `scene.import_ascii` commands) maps glyphs or
  tile ids to prefabs with position and props; `scene.import_ascii {rows, legend}` creates a Tilemap plus the
  spawned entities; round-trips through scene JSON. Test: a 10x6 ASCII level yields the expected tile ids,
  3 coins, 1 player spawn; `factoria validate` checks the legend.

Outcome: the object layer shipped as the `scene.import_ascii` command (rows + legend -> Tilemap + prefabs at cell
centres, tagged `tilemap:<entity>` so re-imports replace them; `save` writes the scene). The legend is not stored
in the scene, so `factoria validate` checks the Tilemap data instead (tiles vs width*height, rows, solidTiles,
tile indices vs the tileset image); the command itself rejects bad legends with row/column and suggestions.
`CameraFollow2D` was not built: SH/FB-0004 was closed by the AI_GUIDE 9.6 "Camera follow with level bounds" recipe.

## M4. Post-processing and glow (M) — DONE (`40b049c`)

Closes: NS/FB-0008 (additive blend already shipped in e2b0090; this is the bloom half).

Acceptance criteria:
- `Camera.bloom` `{ enabled, threshold, intensity, radius }` (default off, deterministic in headless).
- Test: a bright additive Shape2D on a dark background yields lit pixels outside its rectangle when bloom is on
  and none when off (`factoria run --headless --screenshot-at`, compare against pixel counts); cost under
  2 ms/frame at 1280x720 on llvmpipe.
- Documented in COMPONENTS.md and AI_GUIDE (neon recipe: additive + bloom, no hand-blurred sprites).

Outcome: flat fields `Camera.bloom`, `bloomThreshold`, `bloomIntensity`, `bloomRadius` (reflection has no nested
structs); AI_GUIDE 9.20. The cost target was missed: about 5 ms per drawn frame at 1280x720 on llvmpipe, because
the bright-pass read and the full-screen add are each ~1.5-2 ms on the software renderer. Headless tests only
draw for screenshots, so they do not pay it. Only the GL backend was run; D3D11, Metal and GLES3 compile the same
sokol-shdc shaders and fall back to "no bloom" with one error if creation fails.

## M5. 3D physics 2.0 and gamepad input (L, *proactive*, no game reported these yet)

Found while verifying GR/FB-0003/0005: rotation is visual only (colliders are axis-aligned), friction decelerates
a rolling sphere like a sliding one (a ball launched at 3 m/s with friction 0.5 is stopped within 1 s), there is
no shape-cast, fast bodies tunnel (`AI_GUIDE` says so), and gamepad bindings are "reserved, not supported".
Create entries in `ENGINE_FEEDBACK.json` when a game hits them; the package is planned from the physics header.

Acceptance criteria:
- `Collider3D` honours `Transform.rotation` for boxes (oriented box vs sphere/box); a box rotated 45 deg blocks a
  sphere at the rotated edge, not the AABB corner.
- Continuous collision (`RigidBody3D.bullet` or automatic for speeds above one body size per step): a 60 m/s
  sphere never passes a 0.2 m wall in 600 trials.
- Rolling resistance: a sphere with `rollWithMotion` on friction 0.5 keeps rolling (its speed decays by
  `rollingFriction` only); test the distance travelled before stopping.
- `physics.shapeCast(shape, from, to, opts)` for 2D and 3D, honouring `ignore`/`mask`.
- Gamepad: `input.actions` bindings `"Gamepad:A"`, `"Gamepad:LeftStickX"` (+/-), `axis()` and `vector()` work;
  `game.gamepad(index).press/axis(...)` in tests; replay JSON accepts the same.
