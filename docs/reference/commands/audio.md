# Commands: audio

## `audio.log`

List the sounds played so far (clip path, frame, volume, bus, source entity), oldest first.

Every play request is logged: audio.play and audio.music from scripts, AudioSource components and scene music (`music: true`; `layer` names the stem of audio.musicLayers), with `ok: false` when the clip failed to load. `frame`/`time` are the scene clock (time.frame / time.elapsed in scripts). Use it after game.step to check that a sound fired. `after` (a seq from a previous call) returns only newer entries; `path` keeps entries whose path equals it or ends with /<path>. Example: audio.log {"path":"jump.wav"}

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `after` | integer | no | Only entries with seq greater than this. Default 0. |
| `path` | string | no | Only this clip: a project-relative path or a file name like "jump.wav". |
| `max` | integer | no | Return at most this many (the newest). Default 200. |
