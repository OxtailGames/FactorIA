# Assets: generate, import and ship

Art, sounds, music, voices and models get into a FactorIA game three ways, and every one of them is a command an AI can
call (MCP tool, `factoria call`, editor console):

1. **Generate** them with an asset provider (`assets.generate_image`, ...), configured like the LLM providers
   ([AI_PROVIDERS.md](AI_PROVIDERS.md)).
2. **Import** files made elsewhere (`assets.import`): Aseprite, PSD, OBJ, FBX...
3. **Write** them directly (`fs.write`), for files the engine already reads (PNG, JPG, WAV, OGG, MP3, glTF, TTF).

Whatever the way, `assets.json` at the project root records where each asset came from (provenance) and how the engine
and `factoria export` treat it (import settings).

## assets.json

The file is optional; the assets.* commands create and update it. Schema: `schemas/assets.schema.json`
(`factoria validate` checks it and warns about entries whose file no longer exists).

```json
{
  "format": "factoria.assets/1",
  "style": {"prompt": "16-bit pixel art, black outline", "palette": ["#1a1c2c", "#5d275d", "#b13e53", "#ef7d57"]},
  "defaults": {"texture": {"compression": "auto"}, "audio": {"normalize": true, "targetLufs": -16}},
  "assets": {
    "assets/hero.png": {
      "import": {"atlas": "characters"},
      "provenance": {"origin": "generated", "ai": true, "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-image-1",
                     "prompt": "a knight, side view", "license": "...", "date": "2026-10-16"}
    },
    "assets/music/theme.ogg": {"import": {"stream": "always"}}
  }
}
```

- `assets` is keyed by the project-relative path. An entry has `import` (settings that override `defaults`),
  `provenance`, `sheet` (sprite-sheet layout) and `analysis` (measurements the tools cache; do not edit).
- `defaults` holds import settings per kind (`texture`, `audio`); each setting is listed below with its default.
- `style` is the house style of generated images.
- Exports ship the import settings and leave `provenance` and `style` at home.

## Generating assets

<!-- Filled by the asset-providers work: providers, ai.json "assets" section, commands, fake provider, style. -->

## Provenance and store disclosure

<!-- Filled by the asset-providers work: provenance records, assets.provenance, the AI-content disclosure of exports. -->

## Import settings

### Textures

<!-- Filled by the texture work: compression (KTX2 / Basis Universal), atlases. -->

### Audio

<!-- Filled by the audio work: streaming, loudness normalization, conversion. -->

## Importing files

<!-- Filled by the importers work: assets.import, Aseprite, PSD, OBJ, FBX, sprite-sheet slicing. -->

## Checks

<!-- Filled by each part: what `factoria validate` reports about assets (size, alpha, weight, loudness). -->
